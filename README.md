This is the first project / assignment that makes me interest and love c++ language. For the first time i can make (remake/rebuild) a song from a code.

Considering transforming this procedural code to be Object Based Programming so we can use Multithreading feature and maybe.. yes maybe.. we can make an application for sound composer, far smoother than this sound made by this code haha.

Made in September 2016
